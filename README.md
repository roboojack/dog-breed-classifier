## Overview

Contains two implementations of a dog breed classifier. 1 written from scratch, 
and one that uses a pretrained **ResNet101** with the classifier layer retrained 
on **133 dog breeds**.

Unfortunately, github only lets you upload files that are <100MB and the ResNet101
model iis ~150MB. I'll see if I can upload a like to the trained model. Currently I
get **86%** accuracy with the transfer model.
